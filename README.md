# Smart Multipurpose Agriculture Robot using Bluetooth HC-07

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a Bluetooth-controlled multipurpose robot designed to assist farmers in performing key agricultural tasks such as seed sowing, soil cultivation, irrigation, and grass cutting. 
The robot is operated using an Android phone via Bluetooth communication (HC-07 module). 
It reduces human effort, improves efficiency, and increases automation in small-scale agricultural activities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Bluetooth-controlled operation using Android device
- Motorized seed sowing mechanism
- Soil cultivation system (cultivator)
- Automatic water pumping system
- Grass cutting unit
- Closing plate to cover seeds post-sowing
- Multi-motor control using driver circuits

**Main Components:**
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino UNO)
- Bluetooth Module (HC-07)
- Motor Driver (L298N or equivalent)
- DC Motors
- Water Pump
- Seed Dispenser
- Grass Cutter
- Power Supply Unit

## üì• How It Works

1. The robot receives commands wirelessly via Bluetooth.
2. The microcontroller interprets the commands and activates corresponding motors:
   - Movement control (forward, backward, turn)
   - Seed sowing mechanism
   - Cultivator for soil preparation
   - Water pump for irrigation
   - Grass cutter for trimming
3. After sowing, a mechanical plate closes the seedbed.
4. All operations are powered using a rechargeable battery with voltage regulation.

## üíª Technologies & Tools

- Embedded C / Arduino IDE
- Bluetooth communication (HC-07)
- Basic mechanics for seed sowing & cultivation
- Custom chassis & electronics integration
